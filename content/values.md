Housing is a basic human right without which a person cannot survive. Homes are not a commodity. A fair system of housing would be provided on the basis of need, not for the purpose of making profit for those that own.

Living in a home owned by someone else necessarily tilts the balance of power in favour of the owner, and this being the way so many people live creates an imbalance that unfairly skews our society towards the interests of those who own for a living and away from those who work.

Everyone would benefit from a new system of housing that was democratic, and run in the public interest.
Until that new system is won, we will fight to ensure people who rent are protected, and private and social rented accommodation is suitable and fit for purpose.

We can only do this through collective action, and with solidarity.
