The Peterborough Tenants Union is like a trade union, only we represent renters.

All of our work helping members and campaigning is done by volunteers, and we're all members. Everyone
pays in and that creates a sort of joint fund we can use to support each other and pursue our goals.

You can join if you rent or if you don't, as long as you're not a landlord and you don't work with evictions.
