The Peterborough Tenants' Union (PTU) has written an open letter to Cllr Shaz Nawaz, leader of the Labour Group on Peterborough City Council, challenging his consultation masterclass where he offers to teach people how to "reduce their tax burden" and make higher profits from property.

On his website (https://info.entrustpropertytax.co.uk/mastermind-2021) he boasts about having made record profits during the pandemic, and helping his clients pay less tax. This is disappointing from a local leader of a party which has committed to ensure companies and wealthy individuals pay their fair share of tax.

It is important to our members, and renters more broadly, because the Labour Party enjoys significant support from people who rent. In the 2015 general election around 40% of renters voted for Labour compared with 28% of homeowners. In the 2017 election, votes for Labour from renters increased more.

Because of this it our members are disappointed to see a prominent Labour figure locally undermine that support by, while paying lip service to the needs of renters, in practice, profiting off them during what has been a heart wrenching time for many, and teaching others how do the same.

The open letter contains several questions, and we await his response.

> _"Our members want local and national politicians to be clearer about how they will help make accommodation more affordable for renters and for first time buyers. The extra profits Mr Nawaz is making are undoubtedly coming either from tax (which reduces the amount of money available for our public services) or from the pockets of the ordinary working renters and homeowners that he and his Party are supposed to support."_

Cllr Shahzad Nawaz has been the Labour Councillor for Park Ward since 2017 and is a qualified accountant. He has numerous directorships of companies related to property.
