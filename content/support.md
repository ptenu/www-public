title: Get help
summary: We help members with issues they're having with their landlords.
---

We primarily help members of the Union, however if you are not a member we might
still be able to help if you are being evicted. Otherwise, please join before getting
in touch, so that we're able to help.

If you're not able to join, you can still look at the guides on this website, which contain useful information.

## What can we help with

We are most able to help with evictions and disputes with landlords.

It's important that you communicate with them via email or letters, and keep a record of everything said.

We can do things like:

- Check the landlord or agent are following the law
- Get information about your situation from the landlord, or other organisations
- Write letters and emails, and negotiate on your behalf
- Campaign publicly about your issue

## What can't we help with

We are unable to help in certain cases:

- Matters relating to the local authority housing register and waiting lists
- Cases of anti-social behaviour
- (In most cases) ongoing court proceedings

Get in touch and we may still be able to give you some general advice or information.

## How to access help

Call the number at the bottom of the page or email [support@peterboroughtenants.org](mailto:support@peterboroughtenants.org).

You can also contact us via our social media accounts, although we will reply to calls and emails more quickly.

Our phone line is run by volunteers; if we don't answer straight away we will try and get back to you in a day or two.
