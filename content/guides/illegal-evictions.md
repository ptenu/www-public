Thankfully illegal evictions are rare, but you should know your rights.

Your landlord cannot remove you from the property by force unless they have been to court and have a high court bailiff.

If your landlord does this, or tries to do this, they are committing a criminal offence.

## Invalid Notice

If you receive notice from your landlord that they intend to evict you, or they simply ask you to leave, remember that you do not have to go until you have been properly served a Section 8 or 21 notice, and the notice date has passed.

If you think the notice you've been given isn't correct, get in touch with us quickly and we can check it for you.

## Sudden eviction

Without a possession order, your landlord cannot lawful enter your home without your permission. Even if they have this order, they must be accompanied by a bailiff, and only a high court bailiff can use force.

If your landlord turns up out of the blue, or at very short notice and tries to enter or use force to evict you, they are committing a crime, so call 999 and ask for the police. Then call the Union so we can arrange emergency support.

If your landlord tells you at any time that they will be evicting you in the near future, but you haven't had a notice, call us immediately.
