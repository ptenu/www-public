summary: Getting an eviction notice is very stressful, here's what you should do if you get one.

## 1. Don't panic

Facing eviction is very stressful and can be upsetting.

Nothing is going to happen today. Have a cup of tea, call a friend, try to calm down a little bit, and take some time for yourself. You have plenty of time to sort this out.

## 2. Check the eviction notice

The eviction notice can be invalidated if it is not completed correctly. It must give you the right amount of notice, and will either be a "Section 21" or (less often) a "Section 8" notice.

We will want to see this (as well as your tenancy agreement) as soon as possible, so keep it somewhere safe.

## 3. Call us

Call us on 0800 707 42 02, or message our Facebook page or Instagram account.

## 4. Decide if you want to leave

Most often, you don't want to leave, but you may decide that it's now the most straightforward option.

Either way, have a think about what you want to do. Even if you're happy to go quietly, you may not want to do it on the landlords terms or timetable.

## 5. Make a plan B

Can you find somewhere else to live? We always try to help members stay in their current homes, but landlords have a lot of power in this situation.

However having a backup plan will make the experience less stressful and means you'll be ready if you do have to move out.
